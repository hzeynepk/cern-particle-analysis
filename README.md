# CERN Jet Frequency Analysis

This project analyzes real collision data from the CMS experiment at CERN to determine the frequency of jet counts observed in proton-proton collisions.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: CERN Open Data Portal
- File used: MultiJetRun2010B.csv
- Column of interest: `nJets` (number of jets observed per collision event)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To visualize how many jets are typically observed in collision events, and identify the most common jet counts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output
The following bar chart shows the frequency distribution of jet counts:

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## âœ¨ Outcome
This simple analysis reveals that most events involve 2 jets, with frequency decreasing as jet count increases.
